## Abstract: 
The rapid growth of online movie streaming services has led to an overwhelming number of movie options, making it challenging for users to find movies that suit their tastes. This paper proposes a movie recommendation system using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie recommendations. Our system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and movie attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in recommending movies that align with user preferences.
